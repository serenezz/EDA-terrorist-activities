# Global Terrorism Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing global terrorism data using the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd) (GTD) sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017. The analysis covers various aspects such as attack types, target types, regions, countries, terrorist groups, and casualties. The goal is to provide insights into the patterns and trends of global terrorism.

## EDA and Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as count plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and interactive maps to better understand the data. These visualizations help in identifying trends and patterns in the dataset.
